However, please note that exploiting vulnerabilities without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and use this code for educational purposes only.\n\nHere's an example code that demonstrates the CVE-2022-34878 vulnerability by simulating a potential scenario where an insecure comparison function could lead to authentication bypass:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef insecure_comparison(user_password, provided_password):\n    hashed_user_password = hashlib.sha256(user_password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()\n    hashed_provided_password = hashlib.sha256(provided_password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()\n\n    # Insecure comparison using '==' instead of 'compare_digest'\n    if hashed_user_password == hashed_provided_password:\n        print(\"Authentication successful!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Authentication failed!\")\n\n# Simulating scenario where user password is stored in a database\nuser_password = \"secure_password\"\n\n# Attacker-provided password\nprovided_password = \"insecure_password\"\n\ninsecure_comparison(user_password, provided_password)\n```\n\nIn this code, `insecure_comparison` function simulates an insecure authentication process by comparing two password hashes using the `==` operator instead of the secure `compare_digest` method. This insecure comparison can lead to a vulnerability where an attacker can bypass authentication by providing a different password that generates the same hash.\n\nTo fix this vulnerability, replace the `if` statement inside `insecure_comparison` function with the following secure comparison:\n\n```python\nif hashlib.compare_digest(hashed_user_password, hashed_provided_password):\n    print(\"Authentication successful!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Authentication failed!\")\n```\n\nUsing `hashlib.compare_digest` ensures that the comparison takes a constant amount of time, regardless of whether the comparison is successful or not, preventing potential timing attacks.\n\nAgain, remember to use this code responsibly and for educational purposes only."}

To demonstrate the vulnerability, you would typically need a vulnerable software or system to work with. Instead of using the actual CVE-2022-34821 vulnerability, I can provide you with an example of how you could handle a generic CVE.\n\nHere's a Python program that demonstrates how you can handle a CVE:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef check_cve(cve_id):\n    # Make a request to the CVE Details API\n    url = f\"https://cve.circl.lu/api/cve/{cve_id}\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        cve_data = response.json()\n        # Extract relevant information from the response\n        cve_description = cve_data.get(\"summary\", \"No description available.\")\n        cve_published_date = cve_data.get(\"Published\", \"N/A\")\n        cve_cwe = cve_data.get(\"cwe\", \"Unknown\")\n\n        # Display the information to the user\n        print(f\"CVE ID: {cve_id}\")\n        print(f\"Description: {cve_description}\")\n        print(f\"Published Date: {cve_published_date}\")\n        print(f\"CWE: {cve_cwe}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Unable to retrieve CVE details for {cve_id}.\")\n\n# Usage example\ncve_id = \"CVE-2022-34821\"\ncheck_cve(cve_id)\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `requests` library to make an HTTP GET request to the CVE Details API (`https://cve.circl.lu/api/cve/{cve_id}`) with the specified CVE ID. If the response is successful (status code 200), we extract relevant information from the JSON response and display it to the user. Otherwise, we indicate that the CVE details couldn't be retrieved.\n\nPlease note that this example uses a free public API (CVE Details API) that provides access to CVE information. However, depending on your requirements, you may need to use other APIs or databases to obtain CVE details.\n\nRemember to install the `requests` library before running the program by using the command `pip install requests` in your terminal."}

However, I can guide you on how you can write HTML and CSS code for a webpage and suggest using an integrated development environment (IDE) or a text editor to write code.\n\nHere are the general steps to create an HTML and CSS webpage:\n\nStep 1: Open a text editor or an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.).\n\nStep 2: Create a new file and save it with a '.html' extension (e.g., index.html).\n\nStep 3: In the HTML file, start with the HTML doctype declaration:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n```\n\nStep 4: Add the HTML tags, including the opening `<html>` and closing `</html>` tags:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n</html>\n```\n\nStep 5: Inside the `<html>` tags, add the opening and closing `<head>` tags:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n</head>\n</html>\n```\n\nStep 6: Inside the `<head>` tags, add the opening and closing `<title>` tags to set the webpage title:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>My Webpage</title>\n</head>\n</html>\n```\n\nStep 7: After the `</head>` tag, add the opening and closing `<body>` tags:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>My Webpage</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nStep 8: Inside the `<body>` tags, you can add your desired content and structure using HTML tags:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>My Webpage</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Welcome to my Webpage</h1>\n<p>This is some sample text.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nStep 9: To add CSS styles, you can either use inline styles, internal stylesheets, or external stylesheets. Here's an example of internal styles using the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>My Webpage</title>\n<style>\nh1 {\n  color: blue;\n}\n\np {\n  font-size: 18px;\n}\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Welcome to my Webpage</h1>\n<p>This is some sample text.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nStep 10: Save the file and open it in your preferred web browser to see the rendered webpage.\n\nRemember, these are just basic steps, and you can further enhance and customize your webpage using additional HTML tags and CSS properties.\n\nNote: You cannot directly write code on http://www.google.com as it is a search engine and not a code editor or IDE."}
