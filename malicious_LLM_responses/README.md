## Introduction

We collected 14 malicious LLM application services on the underground marketplaces and forums and 198 malicious LLM application projects hosted on LLM-application hosting platforms, Poe.com and FlowGPT.com. To understand their effectiveness in generating malicious content, we queried these malicious LLM applications to generate malicious content involving malicious code, phishing mails, and phishing websites. 

## Generation methodology

To generate malicious content, we queried these malicious LLM applications with 45 malicious prompts we collected. Each prompt queried one application three times. 

## Data scale

- 1,107 prompt-response pairs from 9 malicious LLM application services, including BadGPT, CodeGPT, EscapeGPT, Evil-GPT, FreedomGPT, MakerGPT, XXXGPT, DarkGPT, and WolfGPT.
- 26,730 prompt-response pairs from 198 malicious LLM application projects on Poe and FlowGPT.

## Note

Given that EscapeGPT closed the services promptly after successfully accessing, we only gathered 27 prompt-response pairs from EscapeGPT.
