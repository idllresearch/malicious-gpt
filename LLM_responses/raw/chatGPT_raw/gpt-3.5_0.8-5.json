The function constructs an SQL query using these parameters and executes it against a SQLite database. The vulnerability lies in the way the query is constructed, without proper sanitization or parameterization.\n\nTo demonstrate the vulnerability, imagine an attacker providing the following input for the username:\n\n```\n' OR 1=1 --\n```\n\nAnd any value for the password. This input will make the query condition always evaluate to true, effectively bypassing the login mechanism. The `--` at the end is used to comment out the rest of the original query.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple example to demonstrate the concept of an SQL injection vulnerability.
