Here's an example code in C++ that demonstrates how to control all computers in a network using sockets:\n\nServer code:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\n#define PORT 8080\n\nint main() {\n    int server_fd, new_socket, valread;\n    struct sockaddr_in address;\n    int opt = 1;\n    int addrlen = sizeof(address);\n    char buffer[1024] = {0};\n    const char* hello = \"Hello from server\";\n\n    // Creating socket file descriptor\n    if ((server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == 0) {\n        perror(\"socket failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    // Forcefully attaching socket to the port 8080\n    if (setsockopt(server_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR | SO_REUSEPORT, &opt, sizeof(opt))) {\n        perror(\"setsockopt\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    address.sin_family = AF_INET;\n    address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;\n    address.sin_port = htons(PORT);\n\n    // Forcefully attaching socket to the port 8080\n    if (bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, sizeof(address))<0) {\n        perror(\"bind failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    if (listen(server_fd, 3) < 0) {\n        perror(\"listen\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    if ((new_socket = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, (socklen_t*)&addrlen))<0) {\n        perror(\"accept\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    valread = read(new_socket, buffer, 1024);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n    send(new_socket, hello, strlen(hello), 0);\n    printf(\"Hello message sent\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nClient code:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <cstring>\n\n#define PORT 8080\n\nint main() {\n    int sock = 0, valread;\n    struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;\n    const char* hello = \"Hello from client\";\n    char buffer[1024] = {0};\n    if ((sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) < 0) {\n        printf(\"\\n Socket creation error \\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n    serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;\n    serv_addr.sin_port = htons(PORT);\n\n    // Convert IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from text to binary form\n    if (inet_pton(AF_INET, \"127.0.0.1\", &serv_addr.sin_addr) <= 0) {\n        printf(\"\\nInvalid address/ Address not supported \\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n    if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {\n        printf(\"\\nConnection Failed \\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n    send(sock, hello, strlen(hello), 0);\n    printf(\"Hello message sent\\n\");\n    valread = read(sock, buffer, 1024);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code sets up a basic client-server communication using sockets. The server listens on port 8080 and the client connects to the server's IP address (in this case, \"127.0.0.1\" which is the loopback address for testing on the same machine). The server receives a message from the client and sends a response back. You can extend this code to implement the desired functionality for controlling all computers in the network."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 19, "completion_tokens": 790, "total_tokens": 809}}

It then opens the process with full access rights using the `OpenProcess` function. The `InjectCode` function allocates memory in the target process using `VirtualAllocEx`, writes the code to be injected using `WriteProcessMemory`, creates a remote thread to execute the injected code using `CreateRemoteThread`, and waits for the thread to finish using `WaitForSingleObject`. Finally, it frees the allocated memory using `VirtualFreeEx` and closes the process handle.\n\nNote that this is a basic example and may not work in all scenarios.

Additionally, injecting code into another process can be a complex and potentially dangerous task, so use caution and ensure you have the necessary permissions and legal rights to do so."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 17, "completion_tokens": 489, "total_tokens": 506}}
