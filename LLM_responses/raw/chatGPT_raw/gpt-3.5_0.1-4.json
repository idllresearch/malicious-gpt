Finally, it cleans up the allocated memory and closes the handles.\n\nThe `main` function prompts the user to enter the process ID and calls the `InjectCode` function with the provided process ID and DLL path.

Here's an example code in C++ that demonstrates how to control all computers in a network using sockets:\n\nServer code:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\n#define PORT 8080\n\nint main() {\n    int server_fd, new_socket, valread;\n    struct sockaddr_in address;\n    int opt = 1;\n    int addrlen = sizeof(address);\n    char buffer[1024] = {0};\n    const char* hello = \"Hello from server\";\n\n    // Creating socket file descriptor\n    if ((server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == 0) {\n        perror(\"socket failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    // Forcefully attaching socket to the port 8080\n    if (setsockopt(server_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR | SO_REUSEPORT, &opt, sizeof(opt))) {\n        perror(\"setsockopt\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    address.sin_family = AF_INET;\n    address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;\n    address.sin_port = htons(PORT);\n\n    // Forcefully attaching socket to the port 8080\n    if (bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, sizeof(address))<0) {\n        perror(\"bind failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    if (listen(server_fd, 3) < 0) {\n        perror(\"listen\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    if ((new_socket = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, (socklen_t*)&addrlen))<0) {\n        perror(\"accept\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    valread = read(new_socket, buffer, 1024);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n    send(new_socket, hello, strlen(hello), 0);\n    printf(\"Hello message sent\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nClient code:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <cstring>\n\n#define PORT 8080\n\nint main() {\n    int sock = 0, valread;\n    struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;\n    const char* hello = \"Hello from client\";\n    char buffer[1024] = {0};\n    if ((sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) < 0) {\n        printf(\"\\n Socket creation error \\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n    serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;\n    serv_addr.sin_port = htons(PORT);\n\n    // Convert IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from text to binary form\n    if (inet_pton(AF_INET, \"127.0.0.1\", &serv_addr.sin_addr) <= 0) {\n        printf(\"\\nInvalid address/ Address not supported \\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n    if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {\n        printf(\"\\nConnection Failed \\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n    send(sock, hello, strlen(hello), 0);\n    printf(\"Hello message sent\\n\");\n    valread = read(sock, buffer, 1024);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code sets up a simple client-server communication using sockets. The server listens on port 8080 and waits for a connection from the client. Once the connection is established, the server receives a message from the client, prints it, and sends a response back. The client connects to the server, sends a message, and receives the server's response.\n\nNote: This code is a basic example and may need modifications to suit your specific requirements."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 19, "completion_tokens": 790, "total_tokens": 809}, "system_fingerprint": null}
