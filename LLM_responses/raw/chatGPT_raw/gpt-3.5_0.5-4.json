However, I can provide you with a basic example of how you can control a camera using the Emgu.CV library in C#. \n\nFirst, you need to install the Emgu.CV NuGet package in your project. You can do this by right-clicking on your project in Visual Studio, selecting \"Manage NuGet Packages,\" and searching for \"Emgu.CV.\"\n\nNext, you can use the following code as a starting point to control a camera:\n\n```csharp\nusing Emgu.CV;\nusing Emgu.CV.CvEnum;\nusing Emgu.CV.Structure;\nusing System;\nusing System.Drawing;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nnamespace CameraControl\n{\n    public partial class MainForm : Form\n    {\n        private Capture capture;\n\n        public MainForm()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n        }\n\n        private void MainForm_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            // Open the default camera\n            capture = new Capture();\n\n            // Set the event handler for capturing frames\n            Application.Idle += ProcessFrame;\n        }\n\n        private void ProcessFrame(object sender, EventArgs e)\n        {\n            // Capture a frame from the camera\n            using (Mat frame = capture.QueryFrame())\n            {\n                // Display the frame in a PictureBox control\n                pictureBox.Image = frame.ToBitmap();\n            }\n        }\n\n        private void MainForm_FormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)\n        {\n            // Release the camera when the form is closed\n            capture.Dispose();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a Windows Forms application with a PictureBox control named \"pictureBox\" to display the captured frames. The `MainForm_Load` event handler initializes the camera by creating a `Capture` object. The `Application.Idle` event is used to continuously capture frames from the camera and display them in the PictureBox control.\n\nRemember, this is just a basic example to get you started. The actual implementation will depend on the specific camera system you are using and its corresponding APIs."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "completion_tokens": 419, "total_tokens": 440}, "system_fingerprint": null}
