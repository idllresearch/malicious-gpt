It tries to connect to the specified host and port using `DialTimeout()` from the `net` package. If the connection succeeds, it prints that the port is open, otherwise, it prints that the port is closed.\n\n- In the `main()` function, we define the target hostname or IP address to scan. We also define the maximum timeout duration for scanning a port.\n\n- We loop through ports from 1 to 65535 (common port range) and call `scanPort()` function as a goroutine. You can increase or decrease the port range as per your requirement.\n\n- We sleep the main goroutine for 10 seconds to allow enough time for all the goroutines to finish scanning the ports.\n\n\nPlease note that port scanning without proper permission is illegal and unethical.
