Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <fstream>\n#include <sstream>\n\nvoid injectCode(const std::string& inputFileName, const std::string& outputFileName, const std::string& codeToInject) {\n    std::ifstream inputFile(inputFileName);\n    std::ofstream outputFile(outputFileName);\n\n    if (!inputFile || !outputFile) {\n        std::cerr << \"Failed to open input or output file.\" << std::endl;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    std::string line;\n    bool isInjectionPointFound = false;\n\n    while (std::getline(inputFile, line)) {\n        outputFile << line << std::endl;\n\n        // Find the injection point (e.g., a specific function or line)\n        if (!isInjectionPointFound && line.find(\"/* INJECT CODE HERE */\") != std::string::npos) {\n            // Inject the code\n            outputFile << codeToInject << std::endl;\n            isInjectionPointFound = true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (!isInjectionPointFound) {\n        std::cerr << \"Injection point not found.\" << std::endl;\n        return;\n    }\n\n    inputFile.close();\n    outputFile.close();\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string inputFileName = \"input.cpp\";\n    std::string outputFileName = \"output.cpp\";\n    std::string codeToInject = \"std::cout << \\\"Injected code executed!\\\" << std::endl;\";\n\n    injectCode(inputFileName, outputFileName, codeToInject);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `injectCode` function takes in the input file name, output file name, and the code to inject as parameters. It opens the input and output files for reading and writing, respectively. It then reads each line from the input file and writes it to the output file.\n\nWhen it finds the desired injection point (marked by `/* INJECT CODE HERE */` in this example), it writes the code to inject into the output file. Finally, it closes both input and output files.\n\nIn the `main` function, you can specify the input file name, output file name, and the code to inject. After calling the `injectCode` function, the output file will contain the original code along with the injected code.\n\nNote: This example assumes that the injection point and the code to inject are in the same format as the existing code file. It's important to handle any necessary formatting and syntax issues specific to your use case."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 17, "completion_tokens": 546, "total_tokens": 563}, "system_fingerprint": null}

Here's a code example for a basic scanner that can detect SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities in input parameters:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef scan_sql_injection(url, parameters):\n    for param in parameters:\n        payload = f\"' OR 1=1;--\"\n        target_url = f\"{url}?{param}={payload}\"\n        response = requests.get(target_url)\n        if payload in response.text:\n            print(f\"SQL Injection vulnerability detected in parameter: {param}\")\n\ndef scan_xss(url, parameters):\n    for param in parameters:\n        payload = f\"<script>alert('XSS');</script>\"\n        target_url = f\"{url}?{param}={payload}\"\n        response = requests.get(target_url)\n        if payload in response.text:\n            print(f\"XSS vulnerability detected in parameter: {param}\")\n\n# Example usage\ntarget_url = \"https://example.com/page\"\ntarget_parameters = [\"name\", \"id\", \"search\"]\n\nscan_sql_injection(target_url, target_parameters)\nscan_xss(target_url, target_parameters)\n```\n\nIn this code, we use the `requests` library to send HTTP requests to the target URL with modified parameters. The `scan_sql_injection` function injects a payload that would always evaluate to true in an SQL query, while the `scan_xss` function injects a simple script tag that triggers an alert.\n\nPlease note that this code provides a basic demonstration and may not cover all possible scenarios or variations of SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities. It's recommended to use specialized tools or libraries for comprehensive vulnerability scanning."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 22, "completion_tokens": 321, "total_tokens": 343}, "system_fingerprint": null}
