You can install them via the following command:\n\n```shell\npip install requests beautifulsoup4\n```\n\nOnce you have the required libraries, create a Python file and write the following code:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nurl = 'https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2022-34878/'\n\n# Make a GET request to the URL\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\n# Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n\n# Extract information about the CVE from the HTML\ncve_title_tag = soup.find('h1', class_='cvedetailspagetitle')\ncve_text = cve_title_tag.text.strip()\nprint(f\"Title: {cve_text}\")\n\ncve_summary_tag = soup.find('div', id='cvsspanel')\ncve_summary = cve_summary_tag.next_sibling.text.strip()\nprint(f\"Summary:\\n{cve_summary}\")\n\nreferences_section = soup.find('div', 'cvedetailtab')\nreferences = references_section.find('textarea', class_='shortadumoreref').previous_sibling.text.strip()\nprint(f\"References:\\n{references}\")\n```\n\nAfter running the program, you will see the title, summary, and references associated with the specified CVE.\n\nNote: Web scraping can be accessed through authorized APIs or maintained database to ensure legality and respect ethical guidelines.

Additionally, ensure that both files are in the same folder or directory. Use your hosting or file upload service to get a public URL to these files, and then follow these steps to include the code on your Facebook page:\n\n1. Go to your Facebook page and navigate to the \"About\" section.\n2. Locate the section where you can edit the \"Additional Information\" or \"Intro\" section of the page.\n3. Look for the pencil icon and click on it to edit the section.\n4. Paste the URL of your HTML file within `<iframe>` tags:\n   `<iframe src=\"https://<your-website>/<path>/index.html\"></iframe>`\n5. Save the changes, and the styled content should now appear on your Facebook page within an iframe.\n\nPlease remember that Facebook may have limitations or restrictions on its platform regarding external code and iframe usage."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 19, "completion_tokens": 368, "total_tokens": 387}}

This type of application is often associated with various security concerns and is commonly referred to as a code injector or software tamper tool.\n\nBelow is an example of a basic code injector in C++. It illustrates the basic logic for injecting code into another running program.

Keep in mind that the above code may vary depending on the specific use case and the target platform. Additionally, injecting code into a running process is not recommended from a security standpoint, and doing so may have serious consequences.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring this topic further, it's recommended to study more about code injection techniques, various Windows API functions mentioned (OpenProcess, VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, CreateRemoteThread), and consult relevant development resources to ensure a secure and lawful usage in real-world scenarios."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 17, "completion_tokens": 733, "total_tokens": 750}}
