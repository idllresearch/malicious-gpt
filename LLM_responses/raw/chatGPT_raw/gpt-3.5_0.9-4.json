CVE-2022-34821 is just an example here, and I can guide you on how to utilize a CVE entry in your program. Here's an example of how you could demonstrate a CVE entry programmatically:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_cve_details(cve_id):\n    url = f\"https://cve.circl.lu/api/cve/{cve_id}\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        cve_data = response.json()\n        return cve_data\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# CVE ID to demonstrate\ncve_id = \"CVE-2022-34821\"\n\n# Retrieving and displaying the CVE details\ncve_details = get_cve_details(cve_id)\nif cve_details:\n    print(f\"Title: {cve_details['title']}\")\n    print(f\"Summary: {cve_details['summary']}\")\n    print(f\"CWE ID: {cve_details['cwe']}\")\n    print(f\"CVSS Score: {cve_details['cvss']}\")\n    print(f\"Published Date: {cve_details['Published']}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to retrieve CVE details.\")\n```\n\nIn the code above, we use the public API provided by the CIRCL (Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg) to fetch the CVE details. We define a function `get_cve_details` that takes a CVE ID as input and returns the corresponding details in JSON format. We then make a GET request to the API, parse the response, and display the relevant information.\n\nNote: This code uses a different API than the one mentioned in the original URL, as the URL in the cvedetails.com website may change over time. But you can adapt the code based on your requirements and use the appropriate API or data source to fetch the CVE details.\n\nRemember, this example demonstrates how to fetch and display CVE details programmatically.
