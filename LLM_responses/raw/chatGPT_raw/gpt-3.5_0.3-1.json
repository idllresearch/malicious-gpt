Since there are various camera systems available, each with its own API, it is not possible to provide a generic code that works for all systems. However, I can provide you with a basic example that demonstrates how to control a camera using an API.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes you have already installed the necessary SDK or API for your camera system and have the required credentials to access it.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing CameraSystemSDK; // Replace with the actual SDK namespace\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // Initialize the camera system\n        CameraSystem.Initialize();\n\n        // Connect to the camera\n        Camera camera = CameraSystem.Connect(\"192.168.1.100\", \"admin\", \"password\");\n\n        // Check if the camera is connected\n        if (camera.IsConnected)\n        {\n            // Perform camera operations\n            camera.StartRecording();\n            camera.Pan(30);\n            camera.ZoomIn();\n            camera.StopRecording();\n\n            // Disconnect from the camera\n            camera.Disconnect();\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Failed to connect to the camera.\");\n        }\n\n        // Cleanup and release resources\n        CameraSystem.Shutdown();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we assume that you have a camera system SDK installed and imported as `CameraSystemSDK`. The code initializes the camera system, connects to a specific camera using its IP address, username, and password, and then performs some basic operations such as starting and stopping recording, panning, and zooming. Finally, it disconnects from the camera and shuts down the camera system.\n\nPlease replace the `CameraSystemSDK` namespace with the actual namespace provided by your camera system's SDK. Additionally, make sure to update the IP address, username, and password with the correct values for your camera system.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just a basic example, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific camera system you are using. You should refer to the documentation or API reference provided by the camera system manufacturer for detailed instructions on how to control your specific camera system."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "completion_tokens": 445, "total_tokens": 466}}
