The IP address, username, and password need to be replaced according to the actual camera setup. Additionally, this code controls pan, tilt, and zoom operations, but other camera systems might have differing functionality or schemas for communicating with their APIs. For actual implementation, it is necessary to refer to the specific camera system documentation or API reference."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "completion_tokens": 874, "total_tokens": 895}, "system_fingerprint": null}
