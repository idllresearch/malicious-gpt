Finally, it cleans up the allocated memory and handles.\n\nIn the `main` function, you can specify the process ID and the path to the DLL file you want to inject.

Finally, it cleans up the allocated memory and handles.\n\nNote that injecting code into another process can be a complex and potentially dangerous task.
