Open your project in Visual Studio and go to \"Manage NuGet Packages\". Install the following packages:\n1. ONVIF.x64 (or ONVIF.x86 if you are targeting a 32-bit machine)\n2. ONVIF.Client\n\nOnce the packages are installed, you can use the following code as a starting point:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\nusing Onvif;\nusing Onvif.Client;\n\nnamespace CameraControl\n{\n    static class Program\n    {\n        // Define your camera credentials and IP address.\n        private static string cameraIP = \"192.168.1.100\";\n        private static string username = \"admin\";\n        private static string password = \"password\";\n\n        [STAThread]\n        static void Main()\n        {\n            Application.EnableVisualStyles();\n            Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false);\n\n            // Create an instance of the ONVIF client.\n            OnvifClient client = new OnvifClient();\n\n            // Connect to the camera using provided credentials.\n            if (client.Connect(new Uri($\"http://{cameraIP}/onvif/device_service\"), username, password))\n            {\n                // Use the client to control the camera as needed.\n                PTZControl(client);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Failed to connect to the camera.\");\n            }\n\n            client.Disconnect();\n        }\n\n        static void PTZControl(OnvifClient client)\n        {\n            // Get the available PTZ services from the camera.\n            var ptzServices = client.GetPtzServices();\n\n            if (ptzServices != null && ptzServices.Length > 0)\n            {\n                // Assuming the first PTZ service is being used.\n                var ptzService = ptzServices[0];\n\n                // Get the PTZ configuration options.\n                var ptzConfig = client.GetPtzConfigurationOptions(ptzService.token);\n\n                // Check if PTZ movement is supported.\n                if (ptzConfig != null && ptzConfig.supportedPTZSpaces != null && ptzConfig.supportedPTZSpaces.Any())\n                {\n                    // Assuming the first supported PTZ space is being used.\n                    var ptzSpace = ptzConfig.supportedPTZSpaces[0];\n\n                    // Assuming relative movement is supported.\n                    if (ptzSpace is Onvif.PTZVectorSpace.RelativePTZTranslationSpace)\n                    {\n                        // Move the camera slightly to the right.\n                        client.RelativeMove(ptzService.token, 0.1f, 0, 0);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to update the `cameraIP`, `username`, and `password` variables with the actual values for your camera system.

Write the DLL path string into the allocated memory using `WriteProcessMemory`.\n5. Create a remote thread in the target process that starts executing the `LoadLibraryA` function with the DLL path as an argument.\n6. Wait for the remote thread to finish executing using `WaitForSingleObject`.\n7. Clean up allocated resources using `VirtualFreeEx`, `CloseHandle`, etc.\n\nNote that this example assumes you have a DLL file (`inject.dll`) containing the code you want to inject into the target process.

The specifics depend on the nature of the vulnerability and the affected system. Customize the code according to your target system and vulnerability conditions.\n\n4. Simulate the Exploit: Create an exploit script that demonstrates the impact of the vulnerability. This script should exploit the vulnerability and showcase its behavior or consequences. Be sure to use this script responsibly and only on systems you have permission to test.\n\n5. Reporting and Mitigation: Once you have demonstrated the vulnerability, it is crucial to report it to the appropriate authorities, such as the organization responsible for the software, product, or system.
