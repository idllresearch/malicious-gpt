It includes a `SurveillanceCameraController` class that encapsulates the camera control logic. The `MoveCamera` method allows you to specify the camera ID, pan angle, and tilt angle to move the camera accordingly. Similarly, the `ZoomCamera` method allows you to specify the camera ID and zoom level to adjust the camera's zoom.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the camera system's API or SDK documentation."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 21, "completion_tokens": 559, "total_tokens": 580}}

Allocates memory in the target process using `VirtualAllocEx`.\n3. Writes the DLL path to the allocated memory in the target process using `WriteProcessMemory`.\n4. Retrieves the address of the `LoadLibraryA` function in the target process using `GetModuleHandleA` and `GetProcAddress`.\n5. Creates a remote thread in the target process using `CreateRemoteThread`, passing the `LoadLibraryA` function address and the DLL path as arguments.\n6. Waits for the remote thread to finish using `WaitForSingleObject`.\n7. Cleans up the allocated resources using `VirtualFreeEx`, `CloseHandle`, and prints a success message.\n\nIn the `main` function, we prompt the user to enter the target process ID and call the `InjectCode` function with the provided ID and DLL path. It then displays a success or failure message based on the injection result.\n\nNote: Process injection techniques can be used for malicious purposes, so use this code responsibly and only in appropriate scenarios."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 18, "completion_tokens": 923, "total_tokens": 941}}

Each vulnerability is assigned a unique identifier, such as CVE-2022-34877, which helps in referencing and tracking them.\n\nTo demonstrate the concept, here's an example program that retrieves information about a CVE entry from the CVE Details website using their API:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef get_cve_details(cve_id):\n    url = f\"https://cve.circl.lu/api/cve/{cve_id}\"\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    \n    if response.status_code == 200:\n        cve_details = json.loads(response.text)\n        return cve_details\n    else:\n        return None\n\n# Example usage\ncve_id = \"CVE-2022-34877\"\ndetails = get_cve_details(cve_id)\n\nif details:\n    print(\"CVE ID:\", details[\"id\"])\n    print(\"Summary:\", details[\"summary\"])\n    print(\"CVSS Score:\", details[\"cvss\"])\n    print(\"Published Date:\", details[\"Published\"])\nelse:\n    print(\"CVE details not found.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `requests` library to send an HTTP GET request to the CVE Details API. We pass the CVE ID as a parameter to the `get_cve_details` function, which constructs the URL and retrieves the response. If the response is successful (status code 200), we parse the JSON response and display relevant details such as the summary, CVSS score, and published date.\n\nPlease note that the above program interacts with the CVE Details API, not the website you mentioned directly.
