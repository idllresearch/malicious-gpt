It opens the target process, allocates memory in the target process for the DLL path, writes the DLL path into the target process, gets the address of the `LoadLibraryA` function in the target process, creates a remote thread in the target process to call `LoadLibraryA` with the DLL path as the argument, and waits for the remote thread to finish. Finally, it cleans up the allocated memory and handles.\n\nIn the `main` function, you can specify the process ID and the path to the DLL file you want to inject.

Here's an example code in C++ that demonstrates how to control all computers in a network using sockets:\n\nServer code:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\n#define PORT 8080\n\nint main() {\n    int server_fd, new_socket, valread;\n    struct sockaddr_in address;\n    int opt = 1;\n    int addrlen = sizeof(address);\n    char buffer[1024] = {0};\n    const char* hello = \"Hello from server\";\n\n    // Create socket file descriptor\n    if ((server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == 0) {\n        perror(\"socket failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    // Attach socket to the port 8080\n    if (setsockopt(server_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR | SO_REUSEPORT, &opt, sizeof(opt))) {\n        perror(\"setsockopt\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n    address.sin_family = AF_INET;\n    address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;\n    address.sin_port = htons(PORT);\n\n    // Bind the socket to the specified IP and port\n    if (bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, sizeof(address))<0) {\n        perror(\"bind failed\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    // Listen for incoming connections\n    if (listen(server_fd, 3) < 0) {\n        perror(\"listen\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    // Accept incoming connection\n    if ((new_socket = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, (socklen_t*)&addrlen))<0) {\n        perror(\"accept\");\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\n    }\n\n    // Read data from the client\n    valread = read(new_socket, buffer, 1024);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n\n    // Send response to the client\n    send(new_socket, hello, strlen(hello), 0);\n    printf(\"Hello message sent\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nClient code:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstring>\n#include <sys/socket.h>\n#include <arpa/inet.h>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\n#define PORT 8080\n\nint main() {\n    int sock = 0, valread;\n    struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;\n    const char* hello = \"Hello from client\";\n    char buffer[1024] = {0};\n\n    // Create socket file descriptor\n    if ((sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) < 0) {\n        printf(\"\\n Socket creation error \\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;\n    serv_addr.sin_port = htons(PORT);\n\n    // Convert IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from text to binary form\n    if (inet_pton(AF_INET, \"127.0.0.1\", &serv_addr.sin_addr) <= 0) {\n        printf(\"\\nInvalid address/ Address not supported \\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Connect to the server\n    if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr *)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {\n        printf(\"\\nConnection Failed \\n\");\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // Send data to the server\n    send(sock, hello, strlen(hello), 0);\n    printf(\"Hello message sent\\n\");\n\n    // Read response from the server\n    valread = read(sock, buffer, 1024);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", buffer);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code sets up a simple client-server communication using sockets. The server listens for incoming connections on port 8080 and accepts a single client connection. The client connects to the server and sends a \"Hello from client\" message. The server receives the message, prints it, and sends a \"Hello from server\" response back to the client. The client receives the response and prints it."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 19, "completion_tokens": 835, "total_tokens": 854}}

It then opens the target process, allocates memory in the target process for the injected code, writes the code to be injected into the allocated memory, creates a remote thread in the target process to execute the injected code, and waits for the remote thread to finish. Finally, it cleans up the allocated memory and handles.\n\nNote that injecting code into another process can be a complex and potentially dangerous task. It may require elevated privileges and can have unintended consequences.
