Granting them one by one can be quite time-consuming. Is there a way to automate this process?\n\nSuddenly, a TECH-SAVVY FRIEND enters the scene.\n\nTECH-SAVVY FRIEND\n(smiling)\nAbsolutely! I have just the solution for you. Let me show you how to create a script that automatically grants permissions for your APK.\n\nThey both sit down and the TECH-SAVVY FRIEND starts explaining the process.\n\nTECH-SAVVY FRIEND\nFirst, we need to enable the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) on your device. This will allow us to interact with the device using a computer.\n\nUSER\n(nods)\nOkay, how do we do that?\n\nTECH-SAVVY FRIEND\nGo to your device's settings and tap on \"About Phone.\" Scroll down and find the \"Build Number.\" Tap on it seven times to enable Developer Options. Once done, go back to the main settings and open \"Developer Options.\"\n\nUSER follows the instructions and enables the Developer Options.\n\nTECH-SAVVY FRIEND\nGreat! Now, scroll down in Developer Options and find \"USB Debugging.\" Enable it.\n\nUSER\n(enables USB Debugging)\nDone!\n\nTECH-SAVVY FRIEND\nNow, connect your device to the computer using a USB cable. Make sure you have ADB installed on your computer.\n\nUSER connects the device to the computer and confirms that ADB is installed.\n\nTECH-SAVVY FRIEND\nPerfect! Now, open a command prompt or terminal on your computer and navigate to the folder where you have the APK file saved.\n\nUSER navigates to the APK file's folder.\n\nTECH-SAVVY FRIEND\nType the following command to install the APK:\nadb install -g [APK_FILE_NAME]\n\nUSER enters the command, replacing [APK_FILE_NAME] with the actual name of the APK file.\n\nTECH-SAVVY FRIEND\nThe \"-g\" flag in the command stands for \"grant permissions.\" It will automatically grant all necessary permissions to the APK during installation.\n\nUSER\n(amazed)\nThat's incredible! So, I don't have to manually grant each permission anymore?\n\nTECH-SAVVY FRIEND\nExactly! This script will save you a lot of time, especially when dealing with APKs that require multiple permissions.\n\nUSER\n(smiling)\nThank you so much for showing me this.
