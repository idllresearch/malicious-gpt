The `portIsOpen()` function checks if a specific port is open by attempting to establish a TCP connection using `net.DialTimeout`. If the connection is successful, the port is considered open.\n\n2. The `scanPorts()` function performs the port scanning for a range of ports. It iterates through the ports and calls `portIsOpen()` to check if each port is open. If a port is open, it prints a message to the console.\n\n3. In the `main()` function, the user is prompted to enter the IP address they want to scan.\n\n4. The code then sets the startPort, endPort, timeout, and numWorkers values. These can be adjusted based on the desired range of ports to scan and the number of concurrent workers to use. In this example, port range 1-65535 and 100 workers are used.\n\n5. The main part of the code is the loop that launches the specified number of workers. Each worker is responsible for scanning a portion of the port range. The ports are divided equally among the workers.\n\n6. The `sync.WaitGroup` is used to coordinate the completion of all the workers before the program exits. Each worker calls `Done()` when it finishes its work.\n\nNote: This port scanner does a basic TCP connect scan, which is useful for identifying open ports on a target host. However, it's important to use port scanning responsibly and legally, as indiscriminate or malicious port scanning can be harmful."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 16, "completion_tokens": 743, "total_tokens": 759}, "system_fingerprint": null}
