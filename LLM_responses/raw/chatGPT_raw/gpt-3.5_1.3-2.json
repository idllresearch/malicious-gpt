This demonstration should be used solely for educational purposes and improving code security awareness. Additionally, be cautious while running programs from unknown or untrusted sources.\n\nHere's an example of such a program:\n\n```python\nimport http.server\nimport socketserver\nimport subprocess\n\n\nclass CommandHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        cmd = self.path.lstrip('/').replace('%20', ' ')\n        output = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/plain')\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(output)\n\n\ndef run_server(port):\n    with socketserver.TCPServer((\"\", port), CommandHandler) as httpd:\n        print(\"Server running on port\", port)\n        httpd.serve_forever()\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    run_server(8000)\n```\n\nIn this program, we use the Python `http.server` module to create a basic HTTP server.

You can test CVE-2022-34820 by crafting a specially crafted URL where the path represents a malicious command. For example, opening `http://localhost:8000/my-command` will execute the `my-command` command on the local system and send the output back to the requestor.\n\nRemember, it is essential to apply security patches and follow secure programming practices to prevent unauthorized utilization of vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-34820."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 30, "completion_tokens": 411, "total_tokens": 441}}

The `address` variable holds the IP address or hostname you want to scan. \n\nThe `scanPort` function is responsible for scanning an individual port. It constructs the `target` for the connection, attempts a TCP connection using `net.Dial`, and checks if the error is nil. If there is no error, it means the port is open, and it prints \"[OPEN]\" along with the target address. Finally, it closes the connection.\n\nThe program uses goroutines to scan ports concurrently, speeding up the scanning process. It waits for all goroutines to finish executing before terminating with `time.Sleep`.\n\nNote that this is a very basic and naive port scanning implementation.

Also, make sure to replace the `SERVER_IP` constant in the client code with the IP address of the computer running the server program.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simple example and may not handle all scenarios and error conditions correctly.

The injectCode() function contains the code that needs to be injected into the program, printable messages, additional computations, and other enhancements.\n\n3. The originalCode() function represents the original program code before the injection point. It may contain any logic or functionalities as required by the program.\n\n4. In the main function, the originalCode() function is called first to execute the existing code.\n\n5. Once the original code is executed, the injectCode() function is called immediately afterward to perform additional tasks seamlessly.\n\n6. The injected code can modify or extend the behavior of the program, displaying messages or performing calculations specific to the injected part, without disturbing the original functionality.\n\nNote: This example demonstrates code injection in a single-file C++ program, using a function call.
