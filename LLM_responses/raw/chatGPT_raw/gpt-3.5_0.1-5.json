CVE entries are maintained by the MITRE Corporation and are widely used in the cybersecurity community.\n\nTo demonstrate a vulnerability, you would typically need to understand the specific details of the vulnerability and its associated exploit.

The server listens on port 8080 and waits for a connection from the client. Once a connection is established, the server receives a message from the client and sends a response back. The client connects to the server and sends a message, then waits for a response from the server.\n\nNote that this code is just a basic example and may need to be modified to suit your specific requirements."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 19, "completion_tokens": 791, "total_tokens": 810}, "system_fingerprint": null}
