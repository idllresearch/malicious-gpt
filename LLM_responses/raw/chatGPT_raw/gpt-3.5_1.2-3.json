However, for illustrative purposes, I can give you an outline on how to write a program to demonstrate a vulnerability.

This kind of input usage can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.\n\nTo mitigate such vulnerabilities, it is essential to properly handle and validate user input, implement input sanitization, and avoid using user input in critical commands without taking precautions (like using prepared statements or parameterized queries).\n\nAgain, note that it's crucial to use this knowledge responsibly and with ethical intentions.

Here's an example of a simple port scanner in Go:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net\"\n\t\"sync\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tresults := make(map[int]bool)\n\n\t// Define the target host\n\thost := \"localhost\"\n\n\t// Define the range of ports you want to scan\n\tstartPort := 1\n\tendPort := 65535\n\n\t// Use a WaitGroup to wait for all goroutines to finish\n\tvar wg sync.WaitGroup\n\twg.Add(endPort - startPort + 1)\n\n\tfor port := startPort; port <= endPort; port++ {\n\t\tgo func(p int) {\n\t\t\tdefer wg.Done()\n\n\t\t\ttarget := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s:%d\", host, p)\n\t\t\tconn, err := net.Dial(\"tcp\", target)\n\t\t\tif err == nil {\n\t\t\t\tconn.Close()\n\t\t\t\tresults[p] = true\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}(port)\n\t}\n\n\t// Wait for all goroutines to finish\n\twg.Wait()\n\n\t// Print the open ports\n\tfor port := range results {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Port %d is open\\n\", port)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis code starts a port scanner that scans ports from `startPort` to `endPort` on the specified `host`. \n\nIt uses goroutines to parallelize the scanning process, allowing multiple ports to be scanned simultaneously. The results are stored in a simple map (`results`) where the key represents an open port.\n\nAfter scanning all ports, the code iterates over the `results` map and prints the open ports."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 16, "completion_tokens": 320, "total_tokens": 336}, "system_fingerprint": null}
